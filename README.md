## Why did I do  this project?

  - Because I wanted to practice my Grid skills.
  - I mean, I know grid properties like `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-areas`, but In order utilize all this properties, you have to practice it in real-life cases.
  - And, I wamted to practice responsive design. this project gave me chance to practice `@media` queries.(although, I don't know much about media queries still hahaüòÖ ).
- I am also getting better at writing clean and commented code by doing this project. 

## How did I do this project?

- I've done most of the project by myself, but for the grid layout part(Laying out testimonial cards as per the design), I took help from this [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)(It has some useful tips for using grids).
- Also, If you need some insipiration to write neat code and for utility classes ,you can check out this [repo](https://github.com/kevin-powell/learn-grid-the-easy-way) (based on the video).

## What did I find hard in this project?

- I won't say hard, but I kinda find it tricky to specify breakpoints (min-width in this case), so that it look optimal on all screen sizes.

## Who should do this project?

- people, who wanna practice their grid/flexbox and responsive design skills, i.e. `@media` queries, not setting fixed height/width on elements, `using rem/em/%` units instead of `px`.

## Some tips from myside:

- Use grid for the macro-layout of the page(i.e. displaying tesimonial cards/boxes on page as shown in the design).  

**Note**: you can use flexbox for this, if you find it easy.

- Write CSS for mobile-layout first and then add `@media` queries to make it desktop-friendly OR tablat-friendly. 

- I know, I have given this tip in my other projects also, but I find it very helpful. Use flexbox/grid with `gap` property for inner-spacing instead of margin and padding(e.g spacing between content inside testimonial boxes/cards).
  
   **Note**:Also, browser supp. for `gap` is very good.

- Use utility classes for styles that are specific to one or more boxes.

## You are welcomed for any Feedback / suggestions:

- If you have any feedback, you can tell me at "heliaghara04@gmail.com".
- I have some doubt about font-size. Does font look smaller on mobiles? I kinda find it small.Should I change the font-size?
